## Tips
- The maximum number of taskbar jump lists seems to be 10-15 depending on the OS and screen size.
More can be displayed by modifying the registry. Please search for “Windows 11 increase jump list” or similar.
- Store apps cannot be registered directly, but shortcuts can be created and registered.
- The program's FilePicker is limited to exe, but if you edit the TextBox or drop a file, you can register pngs, pdfs, etc.
